## Description:
This project is a frontend-only prototype of an E-Learning Platform named EduLearn, developed as part of an internship/web development task. The platform is designed to simulate the user experience of browsing online courses, watching course videos, and tracking progress ‚Äî all from a clean, interactive, and responsive UI.

The key objective of this project was to build a single HTML file that integrates all major features of a multi-page e-learning website without embedding CSS or JavaScript directly into the file. Instead, external e_learning_platform_ui.css and e_learning_platform_ui.js files were created to handle styling and behavior separately, following web development best practices.

The user interface was designed using modern HTML5 semantics, clean layout practices, and an accessible structure that makes it easy for users to navigate. This simulated multi-page interface gives the illusion of different pages (Home, Courses, Course Detail, and Progress) while technically being one HTML file.

üéØ Features Implemented:
‚úÖ 1. Home Section
Welcomes users with a motivating message.

Lists available learning categories like frontend development, Python, UI/UX design, and data structures.

Provides a clear call-to-action button to "Explore Courses" that leads users to the course listing section.

‚úÖ 2. Courses Listing
Shows a collection of example courses in a grid layout.

Each course displays a title, short description, and a button to "View" the course.

The layout is responsive and adapts to screen size changes.

‚úÖ 3. Course Detail Page
Features an embedded YouTube video that serves as an example course lesson.

Includes a brief description of what the course offers.

Contains a ‚ÄúMark as Completed‚Äù button that stores the course completion status in the browser‚Äôs localStorage.

‚úÖ 4. Progress Tracking
Displays a list of courses with status indicators showing if they‚Äôre completed or not.

Dynamically updates the course status ("JavaScript Essentials") based on user interaction from the Course Detail section.

Uses local storage to persist progress data even after the page is reloaded.

üîß Technologies Used:
HTML5: Used to build the structure of the website, broken into semantic sections for readability and accessibility.

CSS3 (External): Handles all layout, colors, spacing, and responsive behavior.

JavaScript (External): Implements interactivity like marking course completion and showing progress.

YouTube Embed API: Used to display video content within the platform.

LocalStorage API: Persists user progress across page reloads.
